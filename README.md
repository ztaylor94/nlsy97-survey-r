# Predictors and Perception: An Analysis of Gender, Trajectory, and Personal Responsibility on Income
R project mining the National Longitudinal Survey from 1997. This report seeks to evaluate the influence that gender, life trajectories, and perceptions of personal responsibility have on an individual's income. Upward social mobility is a growing issue in the United States, as research has shown a decline in inter-generational mobility in recent decades [[Chetty, Hendren, Kline & Seaz (2014)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w19843)]. Nevertheless, public opinion in the United States often praises the success stories of individuals who rose out of poverty into prominent members of society. However, research has shown that these perceptions are often overestimated [[Alesina, Stantcheva, & Teso (2018)](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/how-closely-do-our-beliefs-about-social-mobility-match-reality)].
